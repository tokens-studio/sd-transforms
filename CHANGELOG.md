# @tokens-studio/sd-transforms

## 0.9.8

### Patch Changes

## 0.9.7

### Patch Changes

- a18c91f: Export permutateThemes utility function, allowing you to input your multi-dimensional $themes.json data, and receive the permutations (single dimensional outputs) as a result. [See docs](./README.md#multi-dimensional-theming).

## 0.9.6

### Patch Changes

- 21608ff: Patches the transformHEXRGBa function to allow for whitespaces surrounding the HEX code. The Tokens Studio plugin automatically adds these whitespaces when working with aliases so this patch removes the need for manually having to remove those whitespaces.

### Patch Changes

- 0e493a1: Fixes comment transformer for descriptions with line breaks

## 0.9.4

### Patch Changes

- de971fe: Fixed the return types of lineHeight, opacity and fontWeight to be number instead of string

## 0.9.3

### Patch Changes

- bd7fe6e: Handle references and deep references for tokens that can be expanded, like typography, border, shadow and composition.
- b69b05b: set font family name in quotes if its name has whitespaces
- 4a3d5f9: Error handle if SD cannot resolve reference.

## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- 01d45fd: Fix hex rgba regex matcher to be lazier about some character matching, warn for errors from colorjs.io hex parsing.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- ce69ada: Consider that properties can also be empty string, which is especially common if the typography/border/shadow tokens are coming from Tokens Studio.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 24a20df: BREAKING: when missing properties inside typography, border or shadow objects, we prefill them with empty string, 0, or some default value.

## 0.8.7

### Patch Changes

- 3f12797: Exclude parent keys can lead to duplicate property keys. Ensure they are deepmerged instead of overwritten.

## 0.8.6

### Patch Changes

- 345e03e: Expose transforms names, so it's easy to create a custom transformGroup and adjust, add or remove transforms in it.

## 0.8.5

### Patch Changes

- d637cec: Use Rollup output.interop for CJS output, to properly handle default exports in our CJS external dependencies.

## 0.8.4

### Patch Changes

- d37eebc: Support values of type number for checkAndEvaluateMath utility.

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- acd3ddb: Evaluate math expressions within complex value types like border, typography, shadow.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- a25a1ff: Add excludeParentKeys option to the transform options, in order to exclude parent keys from your token files. This is useful if you use a single-file export from Tokens Studio Figma Plugin.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 4d3b98b: Fix package exports paths.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 3728d90: BREAKING: remove modifier type files, use @tokens-studio/types instead for it.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 2f2cd8c: BREAKING: Register parser that expands composition tokens by default, and optionally typography, border and shadow tokens as well.
- e23ec38: BREAKING: Register ts/opacity transform, to transform opacity to number between 0 and 1, which is more multi-platform than percentages%. Breaking because people might not expect to have their opacity tokens suddenly as decimal numbers.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- cc7d86b: BREAKING: move the following transforms to CSS namespace, since they are CSS-specific transforms:

  - `ts/size/letterspacing` -> `ts/size/css/letterspacing`
  - `ts/color/hexrgba` -> `ts/color/css/hexrgba`
  - `ts/shadow/shorthand` -> `ts/shadow/css/shorthand`

- cc7d86b: New transform: `ts/border/css/shorthand` -> transform border objects to CSS shorthand.
- cc7d86b: BREAKING: turn a few of our transforms from transitive to default transforms, if transitive was not necessary:

  - `ts/descriptionToComment`
  - `ts/size/px`
  - `ts/size/css/letterspacing`
  - `ts/size/lineheight`
  - `ts/type/fontWeight`

### Patch Changes

- f320d4a: Keep shadow shorthands as is instead of attempting to transform them again.

## 0.5.7

### Patch Changes

## 0.5.6

### Patch Changes

- a824884: Do not use original value for transforms, use transformed value instead.

## 0.5.5

### Patch Changes

- df20034: Allow letter spacing to be a number value, since 0 is a legitimate value for letter spacing.

## 0.5.4

### Patch Changes

- 2869382: Use expr-eval to evaluate math functions like roundTo().

## 0.5.3

- 81362be: Account for token values being of type number in certain transformers.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 48846b3: Fix checkAndEvaluateMath to deal with regular values with spaces in them like linear-gradient(a, b1 b2, c1 c2).
- 4f6da6c: Return original value if mapped fontweight is undefined.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 2ad1630: BREAKING: remove attribute/cti transform from tokens-studio transform group, this is redundant. However, users might rely on it, therefore it is a breaking change.

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- 71d12d2: Improve checkAndEvaluateMath for expressions with more than one unit.

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- a2b2a22: Account for undefined as a token value in transformers. This may happen if a token value is a reference, but the reference is broken. A fatal error in the transform makes it more difficult for the user to find out that they have broken references and to debug it, therefore we guard against it in our transformers.
